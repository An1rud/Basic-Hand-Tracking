# Basic-Hand-Tracking

This project demonstrates hand tracking using MediaPipe and OpenCV in Python. It detects landmarks on your hand, draws them on the screen, and calculates the frames per second (FPS) of the video stream.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/An1rud/Basic-Hand-Tracking.git
    ```

2. Install the required packages. Make sure you have Python installed:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python hand_tracking.py
    ```

## How to Use

- Launch the script. It will open your webcam feed.
- It will track your hand and draw landmarks on the detected hand.
- The FPS (Frames Per Second) will be displayed on the screen.
- To exit the application, press 'q'.
